    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>A Taiwanese mung bean slush is a refreshing, lightly sweetened drink made with tender mung beans blended with ice for a smooth, icy texture. Naturally earthy and mildly sweet, it’s a cooling summertime treat often topped with condensed milk for extra creaminess.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14 ounces mung beans</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar (to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium glass bowl, soak beans in water for 4 hours at room temperature. You can soak overnight, but place bowl in fridge to prevent bean sprouting.</li>
        <li>After soaking, drain yellow water and rinse beans well. Transfer beans to medium saucepan, add fresh water about 1/8-inch above beans, and bring to boil. When beans start to soften, scoop out foamy water on top and reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking into a paste, stirring often to prevent burning. Use a wooden spoon to mash down the beans in the saucepan.</li>
        <li>When only a few intact beans remain, remove from heat and transfer paste into a microwave-proof dish or bowl. Use a potato masher to mash down the paste until very smooth. A food processor might be easier, but I haven't tried that yet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the salt over the paste and mix well. Then add the sugar gradually, adjusting to taste. When sweet enough for you, spread paste into an even layer in the same dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes to "dry" it out. The goal is for the paste to dry out enough to shape it into a ball, but not too dried out that it crumbles or burns. Set aside to cool and proceed with the doughs.</li>
    </ol>
