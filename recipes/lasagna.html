    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta mixture, and plenty of cheese. The meat sauce is usually prepared with ground beef or pork simmered in tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like basil and oregano to develop deep, savory flavors. Between the layers of pasta and sauce, ricotta or béchamel adds creaminess, while mozzarella provides
         the gooey, stretchy texture that makes lasagna so comforting. Parmesan is often sprinkled on top for extra sharpness and to create a golden-brown crust during baking.</p>

    <p>The dish is assembled in a baking dish by alternating layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese until it reaches the top, finishing with a generous layer of cheese. Once baked, the lasagna rests to allow the layers to set, making it easier to cut into neat squares. This hearty, flavorful dish is loved worldwide not just for its taste but also for its versatility, as it can be adapted with vegetables, seafood, 
        or even fully vegetarian versions. Lasagna is often prepared for gatherings and family meals because it’s both filling and satisfying, making it the ultimate comfort food.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in tomato sauce, mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, and basil; season with salt and black pepper. Simmer 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles with olive oil in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with a thin layer of meat sauce; layer 3 lasagna noodles over top. Spread about 1/3 ricotta cheese mixture over noodles; sprinkle about 1/4 mozzarella cheese over top. Spoon about 1/3 meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, finishing with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and sauce bubbles, about 90 minutes. Cover lasagna with foil if cheese begins to get too dark. Let sit before serving for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
